== About Me
I am a second year Ph.D. student working with [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~franklin/ Prof. Michael Franklin] on putting the 'P' in [http://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/ AMP]: that is, taking a systems-oriented approach to using human computation to solve problems in big data. Previously, I worked at the [http://chip.org/IHLab Intelligent Health Laboratory] in the [http://chip.org Children's Hospital Informatics Program] at [http://www.childrenshospital.org/ Boston Children's Hospital] designing storage systems, dataflows, and applications for managing patient information, particularly [http://indivohealth.org/ Indivo], an open-source personally controlled health record system. I completed my undergraduate education in the [http://seas.harvard.edu/computer-science School of Engineering and Applied Sciences] at [http://harvard.edu Harvard University] in 2010.

I am supported by the [http://www.nsfgrfp.org/ National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program] from 2012--2015.
